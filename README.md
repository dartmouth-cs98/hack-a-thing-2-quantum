# Hack-A-Thing - Quantum Computing

## Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
I worked by myself for this project. I know the website to work in to pairs but everyone I reached out to was either already in a group or not interested in Quantum Computing. I really wanted to at least get a taste for this as I have never even heard of it before I had my interview with Professor Palmer. He advised me to try it and I am glad I did.

## Short description of what you attempted to build
I went through various tutorials and videos put out by IBM on what quantum computing is and how to write some simple quantum programs and algorithms.


## What you learned
I feel like I learned everything and nothing at the same time (perhaps a superposition between the two). I learned how quantum computers use qbits instead of bits. Qbits differ from bits in that they can hold multiple states at one time. They are not limited by just 0 and 1 and can be found in a superposition between the two before they are measured. Once you measure them, their position is changed permanently. I learned of the various gates on how to manipulate qbits position. In addition to superposition, I learned you can entangle qbits so that multiple qbits have an effect on each other. Lastly, I learned of the various tradeoffs and limitations of quantum computing compared to regular computing and potential applications for it. 

## How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
My original idea was to do something with cryptography, so I met with Professor Palmer who pointed me in the direction of quantum computing as there are a remarkable amount of applications for it in the field. After doing these various tutorials, I feel like there an incredible amount of applications for quantum and I would love to see what some of my classmates think about them. I really like the concept as I have never done anything like this before and I hope I can get 4 people to join my team so we could tackle this together.
## What didnâ€™t work
I still don't completely understand quantum computing (and I think rightfully so it seems like a very immense and dense field of study). I haven't done an assembly level language in a while, so it was very hard for me to understand some of the concepts what was going on a very low level. I hope I can learn more about the field and how circuits and all the assembly language come together as I continue working with it.
